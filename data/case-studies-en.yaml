  historical_information: >
   I Paid a Bribe was launched by the co-founders and board members of 
   Janaagraha, a non-profit that works to improve the quality of citizenship, 
   infrastructure and services in India's cities. The site was officially
    launched on August 15, 2010, India's Independence Day.
   <br/> 
   The site allows Citizens to report bribes, which Janaagraha uses to push 
   for improving governance systems and procedures, with the goal of 
   tightening law enforcement and regulation, and thereby reducing the scope 
   of corruption in government services. On the site, users can report on the 
   nature, number, pattern, types, location, frequency and values of actual 
   corrupt acts in government.
   <br/>
   Users can sort and view all reports, as well as report "honest officials".
   On average, the site receives about 25 to 50 reports a day. In addition, 
   there are about 20-50 reports and comments a day logged in on the various 
   forums and the administratorâ€™s blog.

    The use of crowd-reporting services has, to date, traditionally been 
    utilized in areas of public works, like reporting potholes. I Paid A Bribe 
    is notable for taking this type of functionality out of the utilitarian 
    realm and applying it to combat corruption. To date, the I Paid A Bribe 
    site has received over 4.5 million visits.
  impact_today: >
    I Paid a Bribe has launched, or is coming soon, to 16 other countries, and 
    may serve as inspiration for other corruption-based crowd reporting 
    initiatives. As of 2012, there were more than 400,000 reports to the site.

    TBD
  challenges: >
    The greatest challenge to the efficacy of I Paid A Bribe is that the 
    initiative is not integrated with government in any official capacity. 
    The platform could also benefit from an improved user-interface, including 
    search functions and access to raw data.
